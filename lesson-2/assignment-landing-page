# Assignment: Landing Page

After completing the exercises for this lesson, you should have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. Now we will use those skills to translate an original desin into a functional web page using modern CSS layout methods. While future lessons will focus on designing and developing websites without code, going through this process will give you a better understanding of how to envision HTML content in your head and think about the possibilities and limitations of CSS. 

## Objectives:

Upon completion of this assignment, you will be able to:

* Adapt a prepared design to a functioning HTML project.
* Create an engaging design based around a specific concept and passage of text.
* Implement custom fonts to create a unique typographic composition.
* Apply visual styles to HTML content using CSS, including a modern CSS Grid layout.
* Publish a site using FTP and practice good file management.

## Overview

The landing page should include a variety of text, arranged to create an interesting visual composition that welcomes users to your web space. The landing page should convey something about yourself using simple HTML content like text and images. Come up with a theme or visual concept to base your landing page around. Consider the use of color and font choice, as well as creative uses of a grid layout.

The page should include:

* Your name
* A hyperlink to your Wordpress blog (e.g. "Blog")
* Placeholders for future projects, just put "Assignment 2" and "Assignment 3" for now.
* Additional text such as a:
    * Bio
    * Poem
    * Quote
    * Joke
    * Recipe
    * Description
    * Song lyrics
    * Data about yourself
    * Philosophical or scientific analysis
    * ???
 * Optional: Images or embeded videos /(large emojis are a nice way to add imagery too!/)

## Template Files

Students will begin with a template website with a 12 column grid and customize it to meet their design needs. This type of "remixing" is a common process in web development and having some base CSS styles to start with will make your job easier. 

**Get the Template Files** 

ðŸ‘‰ See the next page for more detailed information on how to edit the files and how to customize the grid layout, including detailed tutorial videos.

## Submissions

**Draft Assignment**

Upload the HTML and CSS files to your PASS directory. Then take a screenshot of the webpage and submit it to the relevant assignment in Open Studio, along with the public URL.

**NOTE:** A public URL should begin with `http://` or `https://` â€” if your URL says `users` or `Documents` or anything like that it's a *local* path to a file on *your computer*, and no one will be able to view it on the Internet.

**Final Assignment**

For the final submission, we're going to download the files and upload them to PASS for permanent hosting. This also gives you some practice managing files.

1. In the Glitch editor, click "Tools" in the lower left.
2. Select "Git, Import, and Export" then click "Download Project" button to download a zip file containing your project files.
3. Double-click the file to unzip into a folder. Check that all the files are there, noting that "style.css" is inside a folder called "css".
4. Upload these files and the "css" folder to your PASS directory using Filezilla or the PASS browser interface. Make sure to place these files inside the [www] folder within your directory.

* The public URL for your site \(included in the design doc or as a comment in Canvas\) â€” Remember this should begin with "http://" not "file:///Users".
